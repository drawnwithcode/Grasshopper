# Room Program Generator for Grasshopper

This Grasshopper script automates the generation of room area diagrams based on architectural room programs, typically used in design competitions.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Converts room lists into rectangular areas based on their square meters
- Multiplies each area with a user-defined **gross factor**
- Arranges the resulting rectangles to match a given **axis length**
- Automatically writes room names into each rectangle
- Optimizes proportions for small rooms to keep rectangle shapes balanced

## 🛠️ Why I Built It

In architectural competitions, I often receive long room program lists with specific area requirements. 
Manually creating rectangles in CAD for each room, adjusting for gross factors, and labeling them is a repetitive and time-consuming task. This script streamlines the entire process.
